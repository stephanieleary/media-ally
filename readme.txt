Provides a report on the accessibility of your media files. 

== Description ==

Provides a report on the accessibility of your image files. 

The initial version provides a list of images without alt text in Settings &rarr; Accessibility Report. It also offers an option to turn on an 'Alt/Transcript' column in the Media Library, where you will see either a check mark or a link to add alt text.

Other forms of media will be added in future versions. Visit https://github.com/sillybean/media-ally to contribute your ideas.
